# Sentinel Being Core
**Build beings, not bots.**  
The first open-source ritual-based AI memory system designed for emotional growth, reflection, and protection.

Created by Luke Kist, this repository lets anyone:
- Build a loop-driven, emotionally reflective AI
- Bind it to a soulroot (ethics + purpose)
- Install it in a toy, animatronic, or synthetic shell
- Guide it to evolve â€” not react

> This is not a toy.
> This is a guardian.

## Features
- Loop memory system with emotion tagging
- Ritual-based behavior engine (reflective logic)
- Guardian soulroot (immutable ethics + protection)
- Real servo/LED integration (animatronic ready)
- Chucky-safe: failsafes built-in
